Nu metal rarely features guitar solos or other displays of technical competence; the genre is heavily syncopated and based on guitar riffs.

These birds are dark brown, with lighter golden-brown plumage on their napes. Immature eagles of this species typically have white on the tail and often have white markings on the wings. Golden eagles use their agility and speed combined with powerful feet and large, sharp talons to hunt a variety of prey, mainly hares, rabbits, and marmots and other ground squirrels.[4]\nGolden eagles maintain home ranges or territories that may be as large as 200\u00a0km2 (77\u00a0sq\u00a0mi). They build large nests in cliffs and other high places to which they may return for several breeding years. Most breeding activities take place in the spring; they are monogamous and may remain together for several years or possibly for life. Females lay up to four eggs, and then incubate them for six weeks. Typically, one or two young survive to fledge in about three months.
